# SERVICE Conformance Tests

Conformance tests for the `SERVICE` extension defined in
[RFC 0009 — Services](../../../rfcs/0009-service.md).

## What this extension does

`SERVICE` adds a new entity, the `<Service>` (Template Schemas §9): a long-lived
process that a scheduler starts before scheduling the Tasks in its scope, keeps
running for the lifetime of its scope, and stops once the scope no longer needs
it. A Step depends on a Service by listing `service:<name>` in its
`dependencies` (§3.2), beside the Steps it depends on, and a Service depends on
Steps and other Services the same way. A Service publishes one or more named
ports, each TCP (the default) or UDP, whose endpoint the entities that depend
on it read through the `Service.*` format-string scope.

```

The **scope** of a Service declared in a Job Template is the set of Steps whose
Tasks depend on it, declared in the template's `dependencies` lists (§9.1): a
Step that lists `service:X` is in X's scope; a Service that lists `service:X`
contributes its own scope, transitively; a Job Environment that lists
`service:X` puts every Step in its scope, because every Step's Session enters
it; a Service that no Step, Service, or Job Environment lists is unused and
rejected. External Services have every Step in their scope. The `dependencies`
of a template's Steps and Services form one graph (Step→Step, Step→Service,
Service→Step, Service→Service), which must be acyclic; a Job Environment's
entries add Environment→Service edges that cannot close a cycle. A Step's
`name` may not contain `:` when SERVICE is declared.

A Step, Service, or Job Environment may reference `Service.X.<port>.port` and
`.connectAddress` if and only if it lists `service:X` in its `dependencies`; a
Step's Step Environments share the Step's list, and X itself sees all three
values. The rule has no exceptions.

| Value | Type | In scope |
|---|---|---|
| `Service.<name>.<port>.port` | `int` | the declaring Service; Services, Steps (script and Step Environments), and Job Environments that list `service:<name>` in `dependencies`; a required Service follows the same rule, minus the declaring Service |
| `Service.<name>.<port>.connectAddress` | `string` | as `port` |
| `Service.<name>.<port>.bindAddress` | `string` | the declaring Service **only**; never for a required Service |
| `Service.File.<name>` | `path` | the declaring Service's script |
| `WrappedService.Name` / `.PortNames` / `.Ports` / `.BindAddresses` / `.Protocols` | `string` / `list[string]` / `list[int]` / `list[string]` / `list[string]` | the four `onWrapService*` hooks |

## RFC rules these tests verify

- **Extension gating**: `services`, `requiresServices`, `runScope`,
  `dependencies` on an Environment, and the string functions
  `join_host_port`, `split_host_port`, `is_ipv4`, and `is_ipv6` require
  `SERVICE`; the `onWrapService*` hooks require both
  `WRAP_ACTIONS` and `SERVICE`; `SERVICE` requires `EXPR` (§9.9 item 7).
- **List shape and names** (§1.1 items 8–9, §1.2 item 6, §9 item 6, §9.2,
  §9.3, §9.8): 1–10 elements, unique names, identifiers that are not `File`; a
  requirement's name is not also declared inline. A `<Service>` has a closed
  set of properties; `serviceEnvironments` is rejected as an unknown property,
  and so are the keys `jobServices` (on either root) and `stepServices` (on a
  Step), which are not part of the schema.
- **`dependsOn: service:<name>`** (§3 item 4, §3.1 constraint 4, §3.2): a
  Step's `dependencies` may name Steps and Services in one list; a `service:`
  name must name a Service in `services` or `requiresServices` (an unknown
  one is rejected), may not repeat within a list, and may name a required
  Service (satisfied when it is READY, scope unchanged; the listing is what
  lets the Step reference the required Service). When SERVICE is
  declared a Step's `name` may not contain `:`; in a template without SERVICE
  `service:Store` is an ordinary Step name and `dependsOn: service:Store`
  names it (the gating is pinned here, in the SERVICE suite).
- **Scope from dependencies** (§9.1): a Service listed by one Step, by two
  Steps, transitively through a Service that lists it, or by a Job
  Environment (every Step) is valid, as is a Step that lists a Service it
  never references; a Service that no Step, Service, or Job Environment lists
  is unused and rejected, whether or not it has dependencies of its own; list
  order carries no meaning, so a Service may depend on one listed after it.
- **Reference without dependency** (§9 scope rules 2–5, §9.9 item 1): a
  Step script, a Step Environment, a Service, a Job Environment, or an
  Environment Template's Environment that references `Service.X.*` without
  listing `service:X` is rejected, whether `X` is an inline or a required
  Service; the reference is not an implicit dependency.
- **Environment `dependencies`** (§4 item 3, §3.2 constraint 5, §9.9 item
  14): a Job Environment or an Environment Template's Environment may list
  Services in `dependencies`, every entry in the `service:` form naming a
  Service of the same document's `services` or the Job Template's
  `requiresServices`, with no duplicates; a Step name, an unknown Service, a
  duplicate, a list on a `stepEnvironments` entry (which follows its Step's
  list), and a list together with an explicit `runScope` that includes
  `SERVICE` are each rejected. An Environment that lists a Service and gives
  no `runScope` defaults to `[TASK]`, whether or not it references the
  Service.
- **One acyclic graph** (§3.2 constraint 3, §9.9 item 10): cycles through
  Services only (two and three), through a Step and a Service (Step →
  service:X → Step), through a Step and two Services, and a Service that
  lists itself are rejected.
- **Service `dependencies`** (§9 item 4): same shape as a Step's; a Service
  may depend on Steps (complete first) and on Services (READY first, with or
  without referencing their endpoints); an entry must name a Step of the
  template or a Service other than itself; in an Environment Template every
  entry uses the `service:` form and names a Service of the same document (a
  Step name is rejected); not empty.
- **`requiresServices`** (§1.1 item 9, §9.8, §9.8.1): a requirement makes the
  listed ports' `port` and `connectAddress` available under the inline rule:
  to Steps (script and Step Environments), inline Services, and Job
  Environments that list `service:<name>` in `dependencies` (a Job
  Environment's default `runScope` is then `[TASK]`); a Step, inline Service,
  or Job Environment that references a required Service without listing it is
  rejected; never `bindAddress` or an unlisted port; a requirement that
  nothing lists is accepted (unlike an unused inline Service); `ports` is
  required, 1–10, unique, names not `File`, with a `protocol` of `TCP`
  (default) or `UDP` and no port number; no other property; Job Template only.
- **Environment Template root** (§1.2): `$schema` and `extensions` accepted,
  `environment` optional, at least one of `environment` or `services`.
- **`runScope`** (§4 item 4): recognized names only, no duplicates, not empty;
  an Environment whose explicit `runScope` includes `SERVICE` neither lists
  nor references a Service; an Environment that lists a Service and gives no
  `runScope` defaults to `[TASK]` and is valid, and one that lists nothing
  defaults to every kind of Session.
- **Hooks follow `runScope`** (§4.3 constraint 6): a wrapping Environment
  defines `onWrapEnvEnter`/`onWrapEnvExit` always, `onWrapTaskRun` iff `TASK`,
  and all four `onWrapService*` hooks iff `SERVICE`; a hook the `runScope` does
  not call for is rejected. A Service Session's stack (the Job Environments
  whose `runScope` includes `SERVICE`) holds at most one wrap layer.
- **Scope rules** (§7.3.1, §9, §9.9 items 1–2): a Service, inline or
  required, visible to the scripts and Step Environments of the Steps that
  list it, to the Services that list it, and to the Job Environments that
  list it;
  `bindAddress` only in the declaring Service; no `Service.*`
  in `hostRequirements`, `<Service>.let`, a Step's `let`, or an action
  `timeout`; `Task.*`, `Step.Name`, and a Step's `let` bindings never inside a
  Service; `Service.File.*` only in the declaring Service's script; types
  `int` / `string` / `path`.
- **Port protocol** (§9 item 6 constraint 4, §9.3 item 3, §9.9 item 8):
  `protocol` is `TCP` (default) or `UDP`, a case-sensitive literal that is not
  `@fmtstring`; two ports may share a `port` number only when their `protocol`
  differs.
- **Health check and restart** (§9 item 7, §9.4, §9.5, §9.9 item 4):
  `onHealthCheck` defined iff the type is `COMMAND`; every `TCP_CONNECT` port
  declared and TCP, defaulting to every TCP port; a Service none of whose
  ports is TCP must give a `STDOUT` or `COMMAND` check, so omitting
  `healthCheck` or giving `TCP_CONNECT` on it is rejected; a `STDOUT` check
  rejects `readinessIntervalSeconds`, and accepts `failureThreshold` only with
  `healthIntervalSeconds`; `readinessIntervalSeconds` is accepted on
  `TCP_CONNECT` as well as `COMMAND`; the keys `readinessCheck` and
  `timeoutSeconds` are unknown and rejected; ranges of `port`,
  `readinessIntervalSeconds`, `readinessTimeoutSeconds`, `healthIntervalSeconds`,
  `failureThreshold`, `maxAttempts`; `@fmtstring` numeric fields (all four
  health-check fields included) resolved at job creation in the
  `<Service>.let` scope with a whole-field `null` meaning "not provided";
  `completedTasks` is a literal enum, not `@fmtstring`, so a format string
  over a parameter is rejected at validation.
- **Extensions are per document** (§1.2 item 3): an Environment Template's
  `extensions` apply to that document only, so an attachment that declares
  `SERVICE` and `EXPR` may use `services`, `runScope`, and the §2.2.4 host/port
  functions while the Job Template it is applied to declares no extensions.
- **Expression Language §2.2.4**: `join_host_port`, `split_host_port`,
  `is_ipv4`, `is_ipv6` and their signatures.
- **Inline Services shadow external ones** (§1.2.2 item 3): an external
  Service may share its name with a Service in the Job Template's `services`
  or in another attached Environment Template; the submission is not rejected
  for it unless a requirement names it, the Job Template's `Service.*`
  references resolve to its inline Service, and the runner keeps same-named
  Services from different documents distinct.
- **Submission-time checks** (§1.2.2 items 2 and 4): each requirement matches
  exactly one attached Service of its name declaring every listed port with the
  same protocol (no provider, two providers, a missing port, or a protocol
  mismatch rejects the Job); a wrapping Environment from a document that does
  not declare `SERVICE` placed in `jobEnvironments` of a Job with any Service
  is rejected — the two checks that need the combined Job.
- **Lifecycle** (*How Jobs Are Run* § Services): READY before any Task of a
  Step in the scope, a Service READY before any Service that depends on it
  starts its Session and stopped after that Service is stopped, a Service
  that depends on Steps started only after they complete, a Service's Session
  spans exactly the Steps in its scope and ends when the last of them
  completes, Service Sessions
  enter the Job Environments whose `runScope` includes `SERVICE`, `onEnter` once
  per Session, `openjd_env` and `openjd_redacted_env` from `onEnter` reach
  `onRun`, `onHealthCheck`, and `onExit` (the latter setting the variable
  only with `REDACTED_ENV_VARS`, masked in the log regardless),
  `openjd_service_ready` honored only from `onRun`, `completedTasks: RERUN` vs
  `KEEP` on an instance failure, a ready timeout is an instance failure that
  cancels an in-flight `onHealthCheck`, the health check keeps probing after
  READY and `failureThreshold` consecutive failures (a `COMMAND` exiting
  non-zero, a `TCP_CONNECT` refused, a `STDOUT` heartbeat missed) make the
  instance UNHEALTHY, which is an instance failure taking the ordinary restart
  decision, while fewer failures change nothing and a `STDOUT` check without
  `healthIntervalSeconds` expects no heartbeat, a start failure consumes an
  attempt and relaunches in a new Service Session, `maxAttempts` exhaustion
  fails the scope whether before or after the first Task, a FAILED or
  failed-scope Service still runs `onExit` if any of its actions ran and not
  otherwise, a failing `onExit` does not fail the scope, and wrap hooks run in
  place of the Service's actions with `WrappedService.*` populated.

## How these tests are designed

The RFC motivates Services with Valkey, coordinators, and caches, but none of
those is needed to *test* the mechanism. The execution tests use small python
TCP listeners (`socket`, `http.server`), and one UDP datagram echo, standing in
for a service process,
Tasks that connect to them and print what they received, and sentinel markers
on stdout. Listeners probed by `TCP_CONNECT` or by an `onHealthCheck`
tolerate a connection that sends nothing and may close abortively, replying
only to a client that sent a request. The health-phase fixtures make a probe
start failing, or a heartbeat stop, from a Task or from the service itself
once Task 1 has been answered, and keep Task 1 running long enough for
`failureThreshold` probes at `healthIntervalSeconds: 1` to elapse before
Task 2 could be scheduled. The few fixtures that need state to
survive a Service Session, or to pass between Steps, use a file in the host's
temp directory (`tempfile.gettempdir()`) keyed by `Job.Name`, deleted by the
Service's `onExit` or by the consuming Task, and written so that a stale file
from an aborted run makes the fixture fail rather than pass; this assumes the
Service Sessions and Task Sessions of one run share a host, as the reference
runner's do. Nothing relies on a relaunch reusing the Service Session, which
the RFC leaves to the scheduler.

Fixtures that carry no `runOn` gate use `python`, the suite's portable
interpreter. The `bash` wrappers (adapted from the `WRAP_ACTIONS` suite) are
gated to `runOn: [posix]`; `service-wrap-service-hooks-python` is the
cross-platform variant.

## Semantics tested by the execution fixtures

- **Readiness gating** (*How Jobs Are Run* constraint 3): no Task of a Step
  that lists `service:<name>` in its `dependencies` runs before that Service
  is READY, under each of the three checks — `TCP_CONNECT` (`service-tcp-connect`), `STDOUT`
  (`service-stdout-health-check`), and `COMMAND` with `onHealthCheck`
  running concurrently with `onRun` (`service-command-health-check`).
  `openjd_service_ready` is honored only from `onRun`
  (`service-ready-message-only-from-on-run`). A `protocol: UDP` port is bound
  by a datagram listener that signals readiness through `STDOUT`, and the Task
  reaches it through the same `connectAddress` and `port` values a TCP port
  carries (`service-udp-port-echo`).
- **Start ordering** (constraint 2): a Service that depends on another
  (`dependsOn: service:Back`) starts only once that Service is READY, and may
  read its endpoint (`service-dependency-chain`).
- **Stop ordering** (constraint 4): a Service that depends on another is
  stopped first, so its `onExit` can still reach the upstream Service
  (`service-stop-order-dependent-service-stopped-first`).
- **Scope from dependencies** (§9.1, constraints 3, 4, and 6): a Service that
  one Step lists is stopped, and its `onExit` run, when that Step completes,
  before a dependent Step's Tasks run, which find its port refused
  (`service-scope-stopped-before-dependent-step`); two Services each listed
  by one Step are each scoped to their Step (`service-scope-one-step-each`);
  a Service listed by two of three Steps persists across them, holding state
  written by one for the other to read, and is stopped before the third Step,
  which does not list it, runs
  (`service-scope-two-of-three-steps-state-persists`); a Service listed only
  by a Job Environment's `dependencies` is up for every Step through that
  dependency alone, with the Tasks reading the variables the Environment set,
  and outlives them all (`service-scope-via-job-environment-dependency`); a
  Service listed
  only by another Service has that Service's scope, is READY before it
  starts, and is stopped after it
  (`service-scope-transitive-via-dependent-service`); a Step that lists a
  Service it never references is in its scope, so the Service is READY before
  the Task and stopped after it (`service-dependency-without-reference`); a
  Service that no Step, Service, or Job Environment lists is rejected before
  the Job is created (`service-scope-unused-service`).
- **Service `dependencies`** (§9 item 4, constraint 2): a Service that depends
  on a Step is not started until the Step has completed, and then serves the
  Step's output to the Step that depends on it
  (`service-dependencies-starts-after-step`).
- **`runScope` default** (§4 item 4): an Environment that lists a Service in
  `dependencies` without a `runScope` is entered in Task Sessions only, while
  one that lists nothing is entered in the Service Session too
  (`service-run-scope-default-follows-dependency`).
- **`Service.File.*` and `let`**: embedded files materialize into the Service
  Session and resolve through `<ServiceScript>.let`; `<Service>.let` resolves
  `Param.*` and `Job.Name` (`service-file-embedded`,
  `service-let-bindings-resolve`).
- **`join_host_port`** composes a URL authority from `connectAddress` and
  `port` (`service-join-host-port-url`).
- **Numeric `@fmtstring` fields** resolve at job creation; a whole-field `null`
  leaves the port to the runtime; out-of-range or non-integer resolutions are
  rejected at job creation (`service-numeric-fields-from-param`,
  `service-port-from-param-out-of-range`,
  `service-port-from-string-param-not-integer`,
  `service-max-attempts-from-param-negative`).
- **A Session of its own**: `Session.WorkingDirectory` is the Service
  Session's, distinct from the Task's; `OPENJD_SESSION_WORKING_DIR` is set
  (`service-session-is-its-own-session`).
- **Environments by `runScope`** ("Services run inside Environments"): the
  Service Session enters the Job Environments whose `runScope` includes
  `SERVICE`;
  Environment `variables` reach the Service's actions with the Service's own
  `variables` taking precedence (`service-environments-follow-run-scope`).
- **`openjd_env` within a Service** (§9.7): variables set by `onEnter` reach
  `onRun` and `onExit`, override declarative `variables`, and never propagate to
  Tasks (`service-on-enter-openjd-env-reaches-on-run`); they reach every
  `onHealthCheck` invocation of a `COMMAND` check too
  (`service-on-enter-openjd-env-reaches-health-check`).
  `openjd_redacted_env` from `onEnter` sets the variable for `onRun` and
  `onExit` only when the document declares `REDACTED_ENV_VARS`, and its value
  is masked in the log either way
  (`service-on-enter-openjd-redacted-env-with-extension`,
  `service-on-enter-openjd-redacted-env-without-extension`).
- **Session end** (constraints 6–7): a Service's Session is ended, and its
  `onExit` run, when the scope fails (`service-on-exit-runs-after-task-failure`,
  `service-max-attempts-exhausted-task-never-runs`); a failing `onExit` does not
  fail the scope (`service-on-exit-failure-does-not-fail-scope`); `onExit` is
  not run when no action of the Service ran, as when a SERVICE-scoped
  Environment's `onEnter` fails with no attempts left
  (`service-start-failure-no-attempts-on-exit-not-run`).
- **External Services** (§1.2.2): a services-plus-environment attachment
  publishes an endpoint to a Job Template that knows nothing of `SERVICE`; the
  attachment's parameters are Job Parameters; a services-only attachment is
  started and stopped around a Job that never mentions it
  (`service-external-task-scoped-client-environment`,
  `service-external-parameter-override`,
  `service-external-services-only-attachment`); the attachment's `extensions`
  gate the §2.2.4 host/port functions for its own `variables` while the Job
  Template declares none
  (`service-external-client-environment-uses-service-functions`).
- **Inline Services shadow external ones** (§1.2.2 item 3): an external
  Service named like an inline Service, or like another attachment's Service
  when nothing requires the name, is accepted and both start, each resolving
  its own `Service.<name>.*`
  (`service-external-same-name-as-inline-service`,
  `service-external-same-name-in-two-attachments`); with the RFC's Valkey Job
  Template and queue-cache attachment both declaring `Cache`, the Task's
  `Service.Cache.*` reaches the Job Template's Cache while the attached client
  Environment's `VALKEY_HOST` / `VALKEY_PORT` reach the queue's, on different
  ports, and neither answer leaks to the other consumer
  (`service-external-same-name-both-consumed`).
- **`requiresServices`** (§1.1 item 9, §1.2.2 item 2, §9.8): a requirement
  satisfied by one attachment makes `Service.Ext.main.port` and
  `.connectAddress` resolve in the Task of a Step that lists `service:Ext`,
  and in a Job Environment of the Job Template that lists `service:Ext`, whose
  `runScope` then defaults to `[TASK]`, to the attached Service's endpoint
  (`service-required-satisfied-by-attachment`,
  `service-required-in-job-environment`); a Job whose requirement has no
  provider, two providers, a provider lacking the port, or a provider with the
  other protocol is rejected at submission (`service-required-no-provider`,
  `service-required-two-providers`,
  `service-required-provider-missing-port`,
  `service-required-protocol-mismatch`).
- **Failure and restart**: on an instance failure, `RERUN` cancels the running
  Task without counting a failure, relaunches `onRun`, and reruns completed
  Tasks against the new instance; `KEEP` lets the running Task finish and keeps
  completed results, gating only not-yet-started Tasks on the new instance
  (`service-rerun-relaunch`, `service-keep-relaunch`). Exhausting
  `maxAttempts` makes the Service FAILED and fails its scope, whether before
  any Task runs (`service-max-attempts-exhausted*`) or after some Tasks have
  completed, in which case the remaining Tasks never start and `onExit` runs
  (`service-keep-max-attempts-exhausted-mid-scope`). A ready timeout is an
  instance failure: the in-flight `onHealthCheck` is canceled, no Task runs,
  and `onExit` runs (`service-readiness-timeout-fails-scope`). A start failure
  — a SERVICE-scoped Environment's `onEnter` exiting non-zero — consumes an
  attempt and the relaunch begins a new Service Session with a new working
  directory, re-entering the Environments and re-running `onEnter`
  (`service-start-failure-relaunches-in-new-session`).
- **Health after READY** (§9.4, *How Jobs Are Run* constraint 11): the probe
  that proved readiness keeps running every `healthIntervalSeconds`, and
  `failureThreshold` consecutive failures make the instance UNHEALTHY, an
  instance failure that takes the ordinary restart decision. A `COMMAND` probe
  that starts exiting non-zero after Task 1 gets instance 1 canceled and, under
  `maxAttempts: 1` and `KEEP`, a second instance that serves the remaining Tasks
  (`service-health-command-fails-after-ready-relaunches`); a probe that fails
  twice and recovers under `failureThreshold: 3` changes nothing
  (`service-health-threshold-tolerates-blips`); a `TCP_CONNECT` probe refused
  by a process that closed its listener but is still running makes the
  instance UNHEALTHY, and with no attempts left the Job fails and `onExit` runs
  (`service-health-tcp-port-closed-while-process-hangs`); a `STDOUT` check with
  `healthIntervalSeconds` treats `openjd_service_ready` as a heartbeat and
  fails the instance when it stops (`service-health-stdout-heartbeat-missed`),
  while one without expects no heartbeat and a single ready line serves the
  whole Job (`service-health-stdout-no-heartbeat-configured`).
- **Wrap hooks** (§4.3 constraint 6, §4.3.1): a SERVICE-scoped wrapping
  Environment's four `onWrapService*` hooks run in place of the Service's
  actions with `WrappedAction.*` and the parallel `WrappedService.*` lists; the
  wrapped `onRun`'s `openjd_service_ready` and the health check's exit status
  are recognized through the wrap script; `onWrapEnvEnter`/`onWrapEnvExit` wrap
  the inner Environments the Service Session enters; the wrapper is not entered
  for the Task (`service-wrap-service-scoped-hooks`,
  `service-wrap-env-hooks-wrap-inner-environment-in-service-session`,
  `service-wrap-service-hooks-python`). A TASK-scoped wrapper coexists with a
  Service (`service-wrapper-task-scoped-with-service`).
- **Submission-time wrapper check** (§1.2.2 item 4): a wrapping Environment
  from a document without `SERVICE`, placed in `jobEnvironments`, is rejected
  when the Job has any Service — attached to a Job declaring a Service, or in
  a Job submitted alongside an external Service
  (`service-wrapper-without-service-declaration`,
  `service-job-wrapper-with-external-service`).

## Running the tests

From the repo root:

```bash
# Run just the SERVICE extension tests
uv run conformance-tests/run_openjd_cli_tests.py 2023-09/SERVICE

# Run only the job execution tests
uv run conformance-tests/run_openjd_cli_tests.py 2023-09/SERVICE/jobs

# Pattern-match a single scenario
uv run conformance-tests/run_openjd_cli_tests.py '*service*relaunch*'
```

## Writing your own runner

See the top-level [conformance README](../../README.md) for the standard
runner contract. The behavior specific to `SERVICE`:

1. When a template declares `extensions: [SERVICE, EXPR]`, the runner must
   accept `services`, `requiresServices`, `runScope`, `dependencies` on a Job
   Environment (`service:` entries only), and the `dependsOn: service:<name>`
   form in every `dependencies` list; compute each Service's scope from those
   lists (§9.1: the Steps that list it, directly or through other Services,
   plus every Step when a Job Environment lists it); reject an unused Service,
   a `:` in a Step's name, a `Service.*` reference from a Step, Service, or
   Job Environment that does not list the dependency, a `dependencies` list
   on a Step Environment or one naming a Step, and a cycle in the combined
   Step/Service graph; and validate
   every `<Service>` and `<ServiceRequirement>` per Template Schemas §9.9.
   Without `SERVICE` it must reject those fields and treat `service:X` in
   `dependsOn` as an ordinary Step name; with `SERVICE` but without `EXPR` it
   must reject the template. `jobServices` and `stepServices` are unknown
   properties.
2. `openjd run` with `--env` must add an Environment Template's `services` to
   the Job as external Services with every Step in their scope, match each
   `requiresServices` entry to exactly one attached Service of that name
   declaring the listed ports with the same protocols (§1.2.2 item 2,
   rejecting the run otherwise), apply the submission-time wrapper check of
   §1.2.2 item 4, treat the attachment's `parameterDefinitions` as Job
   Parameters, and keep a Service of one document distinct from a same-named
   Service of another (§1.2.2 item 3): a Job Template's `Service.*` references
   resolve to its inline Services first, then to its requirements; an
   Environment Template's resolve within that document.
3. Before any Task of a Step runs, every Service whose scope includes the Step
   must be started in a Service Session of its own — after the Steps in its
   `dependencies` have completed and the Services in it are READY,
   entering the Job Environments whose `runScope` includes `SERVICE` (an
   Environment that lists a Service and gives no `runScope` is `[TASK]`),
   allocating its ports in each port's own `protocol` space,
   running `onEnter`, launching `onRun`, and probing it with its health check
   every `readinessIntervalSeconds` — and be READY.
   `Service.<name>.<port>.port` and `.connectAddress` must resolve in the
   Task's actions to an endpoint that reaches the process.
4. Once READY, the runner must keep probing every `healthIntervalSeconds`
   (`TCP_CONNECT` and `COMMAND`; `STDOUT` only when the field is given, as a
   heartbeat deadline for `openjd_service_ready`), count consecutive failures,
   reset the count on a success, and on `failureThreshold` failures mark the
   instance UNHEALTHY, cancel `onRun` by its cancelation method, wait for it to
   exit, and take the restart decision below.
5. An `onRun` exit while the scope has work, a ready timeout, or an UNHEALTHY
   instance is an instance failure governed by `restartPolicy`: relaunch up to
   `maxAttempts` times, applying `completedTasks`; otherwise fail the scope. A
   failure before `onRun` is launched (an Environment's or the Service's
   `onEnter` exiting non-zero) is a start failure that consumes an attempt and
   must be relaunched in a new Service Session. In every case the Service
   Session must be ended (`onRun` and any in-flight `onHealthCheck` canceled,
   `onExit` run if any action of the Service ran, Environments exited) when the
   scope completes or fails — that is, when no Step in the Service's scope has
   a Task left to run — a Service being stopped before any Service it depends
   on.
6. Under `WRAP_ACTIONS`, a wrapping Environment whose `runScope` includes
   `SERVICE` must run its `onWrapService*` hooks in place of the Service's
   actions with `WrappedAction.*` and `WrappedService.*` populated, scanning
   the wrap script's stdout for `openjd_*` messages.
